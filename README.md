Project requires a csv generated by YoastSEO, or in an identical format like the headers shown below:
id, type, keyphrase, keyphrase_score, url, title, seo_title, meta_description, readability_score, processed
Project functional code all contained in utils.py
Add API keys, file paths, API call limiting, etc to config.py
Use main.py to begin process.
In case of API limit issues, thread worker number may be adjusted, utils.py line 128
On running main.py the program will:
1) Pull the csv information into a dataframe.
2) Pull an url from the dataframe
3) Navigate to the url and scrape the title and body of the website.
4) Send the text of the title and body to ChatGPT 3.5 for SEO Title and meta description generation.
5) Add SEO Title and meta description to the dataframe
6) Repeat with the next url in the dataframe until max API calls per day limit is hit 
7) Either update csv file or generate a new csv file with the dataframe

QC tools are also included for use after completion of the project.
